<p>Call the Chicago office first, but try the DC office if you can’t get through. If you keep calling and can’t get to a live person, then leave a voicemail and also send a follow-up <a href="https://www.duckworth.senate.gov/content/contact-senator">email </a></p>
<p>If you do send an email, it’s essential that you write it in your own words. Copy-pasted emails are discounted by Congressional staff. We have to show that these issues mean so much to us that we’re putting in a serious effort.</p>

<div class="script">
<p>My name is _____, I am a constituent of Senator Duckworth’s in the _____ zip code. I am also a member of Indivisible Chicago.</p>
<p>I am extremely concerned about the Trump administration’s potential ties to Russia and ask that Senator Duckworth do everything in her power to ensure independent and transparent investigations, including demanding that Jeff Sessions resign.</p>
<p>I also ask her to reach across the aisle to find bipartisan support for an investigation of this threat to American Democracy.</p>
