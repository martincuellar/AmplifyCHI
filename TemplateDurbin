<p>Hello, my name is _____, and I'm one of Senator Durbin's constituents in the _____ zip code. I'm also a member of Indivisible Chicago.</p>
<p>I'm asking that Senator Durbin call for an SEC investigation into Tom Price's potentially illegal tradig practices. Last year Secregary Price purchased over 400,000 shares of stock for a company was directly impacted by the health policy changes that Price was working on. He had insidder knowledge of that company, and has other questionable investments. He was already confirmed, but the issue of insider trading should still be investigated</p>
